## stop-motion

This is a collection of bash scripts used to create stop motion animations. I use them together with [IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=sv) to fetch images from an Android device, but a custom command can be set in the config file to use other sources for images.

The scripts included are:

| Script    | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `click`   | Fetch a picture and name it with increasing numbering |
| `preview` | Preview the animation from the videos |
| `render`  | Render a video from the images |
| `go`      | Control the use of the other scripts in a convenient manner |
| `config`  | Configuration file used by the other scripts |
