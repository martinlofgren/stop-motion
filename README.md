## stop-motion

This is a collection of bash scripts used to create stop motion animations. I use them together with [IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=sv) to fetch images from an Android device, but a custom command can be set in the config file to use other sources for images.

The scripts included are:

* `click` - used to take pictures
* `preview - used to preview the video
* `render` - used to render a video from the images
* `go` - used to coordinate the use of the other scripts in a convenient manner
